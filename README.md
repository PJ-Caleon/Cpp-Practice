# C++ Practice Projects

## Overview
This repository is a personal challenge to dive deeper into C++ by building multiple projects before my schedule gets busy again in a few weeks. The goal is to complete **up to 50 projects**, all sourced from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners-advanced/).

In addition to sharpening my C++ skills, Iâ€™ve added an extra challenge: working on a **borrowed Linux Mint OS laptop** instead of my main machine, which I left at another condo. This way, I get to explore both **C++ development** and **Linux environments** simultaneously.

## Limitation
I will only be doing terminal output projects as GUI is a rather different learning curve.
